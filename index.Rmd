## Project thoughts



I am interested in exploring data related to exports in OECD member countries during the last 3 years (2020-2022). The project would investigate, which economies have made the greatest progress over the selected period of time. Besides, I would like to analyze the trends within the EU-member countries: whether the EU membership influences the amount of export in its countries. Also, I am interested in comparing, which countries had the lowest amount of exports in 2020 and how they performed later in 2022. 

To investigate this relationship, I am relying on data from the OECD official website:

1. https://stats.oecd.org/# Key Short-Term Economic Indicators  : Exports

The data contains monthly and quarterly statistics for exports (and associated statistical methodological information) for all OECD member countries and for a selection of non-member countries.
